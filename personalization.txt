REFLECTION


What I Learned:
[Write 5-8 sentences reflecting on Module 1:
- What Bootstrap concepts made sense to you?  It made sense that there was a premade program, so you didn't have to remake it every time.  
- What was most challenging?   It was confusing when there was the "'''html". I thought that I was suposed to add that, but I wasn't, but I got it fixed.
- How do you feel about your CSS customization?  I feel pretty good about it. I feel like I can understand and be able to change most of it.
- What would you add to JagTrack in the future?  I might add the AI bot or some more information, like a monthly schedule.
- How will you use this site for planning next quarter?]  I will look at it and use it to organize my classes and access the page.

Color Scheme Design:
[Write 5-7 sentences about your color choices:
- What colors did you choose for light mode? Why?   I chose the regular colors because they have school spirit and the loook nice.
- What colors did you choose for dark mode? Why?    I chose darker versions of the regular colors because it matches the light mode and is darker.

Theme Preferences:
- Which theme do you prefer personally and why? [Your answer]    I like the light theme because the colors match more.
