REFLECTION


What I Learned:
[Write 5-8 sentences reflecting on Module 1:
- What Bootstrap concepts made sense to you?  It made sense that there was a premade program, so you didn't have to remake it every time.  
- What was most challenging?   It was confusing when there was the "'''html". I thought that I was suposed to add that, but I wasn't, but I got it fixed.
- How do you feel about your CSS customization?  I feel pretty good about it. I feel like I can understand and be able to change most of it.
- What would you add to JagTrack in the future?  I might add the AI bot or some more information, like a monthly schedule.
- How will you use this site for planning next quarter?]  I will look at it and use it to organize my classes and access the page.


Hours Spent: [2.5 hours]
